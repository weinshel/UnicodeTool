# Final Project Proposal
## Ben Weinshel

I’d like to build a tool to make it easier to explore the Unicode character set, with emphasis placed on multi-codepoint characters and emoji, continuing on the ideas that I discussed in my writing systems paper. This would consist of a website of some sort that would allow you to scroll through character tables and click on a character to see its Unicode codepoint and also other information, such as the name and code for HTML or other programming languages.

There are a handful of tools out there that allow you to explore Unicode[^1][^2][^3][^4], but they either are slow to use, difficult to browse, or don’t provide info about multi-codepoint characters. Moreover, I think there is educational value in building something like this, even if similar tools already exist.

I would likely source the character information from the Unicode Character Database[^5], or one of a number of other projects that have converted the database into different formats[^6][^7][^8]. I would then have to build some sort of web interface to process this information and build an interactive character table.

This project would be flexible in terms of scope if one of the aspects of building it is easier or harder than I would anticipate. Overall, it is related to the concepts I discussed in my writing systems paper, and also to the larger course ideas of writing systems and code making.
