# Unicode Explorer

<p>Explore the Unicode character set!</p><p>See all the the characters in a specific block, such as <a href="https://weinshel.github.io/unicodeexplorer/#/#/blocks/cuneiform">Cuneiform</a> or <a href="https://weinshel.github.io/unicodeexplorer/#/#/blocks/cherokee">Cherokee</a>. Learn about a specific character such as <a href="https://weinshel.github.io/unicodeexplorer/#/#/characters/77952">ìÇÄ</a>. See <a href="https://weinshel.github.io/unicodeexplorer/#/#/emoji">all the emoji</a>, or view details about <a href="https://weinshel.github.io/unicodeexplorer/#/#/emoji/smiling-face-with-horns">üòà</a>.</p>

# Background

This web app was built as a final project for the Code Making, Code Breaking course at UChicago (LING 26040 Autumn 2017).

There are a handful of tools out there that allow you to explore Unicode, such as the [official Unicode code tables](https://www.unicode.org/charts/), [decodeunicode](http://www.decodeunicode.org), [Unicode Lookup](https://unicodelookup.com/), and [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/), but they either are slow to use, difficult to browse, or don‚Äôt provide info about multi-codepoint characters (many emoji are constructed as a sequence of codepoints and not just one character, such as [üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶ family: woman, woman, boy](https://weinshel.github.io/unicodeexplorer/#/emoji/family-woman-woman-boy)).

# Technical Implementation

## Data Sources

The character tables and the emoji tables are sourced from third-party libraries that provide processed versions of the character data published by the Unicode Consortium.

The emojis are sourced from the [Emojibase](https://github.com/milesj/emojibase) JavaScript library, which provides every imaginable detail about every emoji, including skin tone variations, alternative names, tags, and emoticon equivalents. The library provides [data structures](https://github.com/milesj/emojibase#data-structure) with the emoji information, and I wrote the frontend to display the grid and then to display the character detail page.

It was slightly more difficult to find a good source for the rest of the Unicode characters; while the Unicode Consortium provides a [text file](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt) with the name and code points of every character, that data doesn't provide exhaustive information about every character and isn't in a format that is easily incorporated into the rest of the code. I eventually settled on a library called [unidata](https://github.com/chbrown/unidata) to get the character data, which it provides with data structures that make it easy to navigate by block. I had to [update the library for Unicode 10](https://github.com/weinshel/unidata/commit/c4fe4ca828d0f8c26693eb4b97e038a7810c8ba5), but once that was done I was able to write my web app to automatically generate the list of character blocks, grids of characters, and info pages for each character.
