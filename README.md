# Background

This web app was built as a final project for the Code Making, Code Breaking course at UChicago (LING 26040 Autumn 2017).

There are a handful of tools out there that allow you to explore Unicode, such as the [official Unicode code tables](https://www.unicode.org/charts/), [decodeunicode](http://www.decodeunicode.org), [Unicode Lookup] (https://unicodelookup.com/), and [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/), but they either are slow to use, difficult to browse, or donâ€™t provide info about multi-codepoint characters.
